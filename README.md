# Job-Recommendation-System

Project Title:::Job Recommendation Engine
Objective:  A job recommendation engine is designed to suggest relevant job postings to users based on their profiles, skills, experiences, and preferences. Such systems aim to match job seekers with the most suitable job opportunities, improving both user satisfaction and the efficiency of the recruitment process. 
For this we have 3 Datasets:::education.csv,employment.csv,job.csv

Flowchart of Job Recommendation Engine
1. Data Loading and Initial Preprocessing
•	Load CSV files
•	Inspect data
•	Handle missing values
•	Convert text to lowercase
•	Convert date columns
2. Data Preprocessing
•	Clean and normalize data
•	Merge user profiles and employment details to create a comprehensive user profile
3. Feature Engineering
•	Extract skills using NLP
o	Tokenize text
o	Extract relevant skills from resumes and job descriptions
•	Create a unified skill representation for users and jobs
4. Building Recommendation Models
•	Content-Based Filtering
o	Combine user skills into a single string
o	Combine job requirements into a single string
o	Create TF-IDF matrices for users and jobs
o	Compute cosine similarities between users and jobs
o	Generate top job recommendations based on similarity scores
•	Collaborative Filtering
o	Prepare data for collaborative filtering
o	Use a collaborative filtering algorithm (e.g., SVD)
o	Generate top job recommendations based on user-job interaction data
5. Combining Models
•	Hybrid Approach
o	Combine results from content-based and collaborative filtering models
o	Merge recommendations and remove duplicates
o	Generate top recommendations from combined results
6. Evaluation
•	Evaluate the effectiveness of recommendations
o	Use metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
o	Compare recommendations with ground truth user-job interactions
